    question: "How do I book a car?",
    answer:
      "Simply browse our car listings, select your desired vehicle, choose your pickup and return dates and locations, then proceed to checkout. You can book online or call our support team for assistance.",

  {
    question: "What documents do I need to rent a car?",

    answer:

    question: "What is the age requirement for renting a car?",

    question: "Can I extend my rental period?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is fuel included in the rental?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I return the car late?",
    answer:
      "Late returns incur additional charges based on your rental agreement. We charge hourly rates for returns up to 24 hours late, and daily rates for returns beyond that. Contact support if you anticipate a late return.",
